                    <p> I am a 19 year old Computer Science student studying at the University of Guelph, with a passion for all things tech. I started coding at 16 and have developed skills in Java, Python, C, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I am currently building this website as part of my portfolio. I am driven by the challenge of creating technologies that can genuinely improve people's lives. Outside of programming, I enjoy photography, videography, and flying dronesâ€”hobbies that keep my creativity sharp and my problem-solving skills keen.
